Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. Creating a remote repository will be helpful when we are ready to share our project/ work with others or when two or more people are working on the same project thus collaborators can work simultaneously. 

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. 

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. Clone - copies a existing repository to a local computer
   Fork - copies a existing repository to GitHub servers - where now you can use/edit someone elses repository because you don't have permission to change Larry's repository!
   Branches - are used to divert from the original task or add a new feature or fix a bug. Its a part of a single repo.
