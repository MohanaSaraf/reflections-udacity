Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. .git hidden file is made that keeps the meta data of all the changes we have made/ the history of all the files. 
If this is not done then the directory would just remain as a normal folder in the system and which doesnt keep the log of all the changes

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. the files in the staging area will be committed when the next commit command is executed. Files in the directory will be untracked files - meaning they are yet not part of the repository and thus we will not be able to keep the log of the changes made in these files
